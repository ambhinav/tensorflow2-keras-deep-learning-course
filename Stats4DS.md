# Statistics & Probabilty for DS

## The Main difference
What is the difference between Statistics & Machine Learning?

- Statistical method: One scenario is where a problem is given and data must be collected to help identify.
a solution to the problem.
    - Suppose a company that sells watches wants to find out why watches are not being sold anymore. What kind of data
  needs to be colected so as to analyze the cause of the problem?
- ML method: We have an abundance of data and a business requires solutions to be derived from the data.
    - Suppose you collect data from users who purchase watches online such as where they live, income levels, the types
    of watches they buy etc. The company wants to figure out how to get people to buy more watches. A few possible
      solutions are rebranding it to a luxury brand for example. How can you make **predictions**  using the data?

## Analytical methods
Consider the role of a Sports scientist at Juventus with data that is collected about a random variable (e.g. Number of goals Ronaldo scores per season 
for Juventus). 
- Descriptive
  - How the data is collected, sampling methods etc.
  - How many goals did Ronaldo score for Juventus last season?
- Predictive/Inferential
  - A model is created to infer outcomes on the values the r.v. will take in the future.
  - How many goals will he likely score next season?
- Prescriptive
  - The aforementioned model is translated into an action.
  - Often, these actions are complicated and must follow constraints in the domain.
    - E.g. when designing an autonomous vehicle, it must follow the rules of the road.
  - How do we get Ronaldo to score more goals on average?
    
Predictive and Descriptive methods are more complicated as they only use data notionally. These predictions and
prescriptions depend on a myriad of factors.
